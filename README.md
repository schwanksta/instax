# Instax - Write code, get an Instagram story.

This is a silly little side project to make Instagram feel more like Geocities by letting people try out weird and dumb code, the result of which can be exported to an image perfeectly sized for IG.

You can clone this and just do `python3 -m http.server` or visit https://schwanksta.com/instax
